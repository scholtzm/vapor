# Vapor Examples

This folder contains several examples which demonstrate the flexibility and extensibility of Vapor client. Each example contains its own README so read those carefully as well.

Almost all examples use these built-in plugins:

* `essentials` - logs all major events such as chat messages or friends list changes
* `fs` - persists files (such as SteamGuard sentry file) to file system
* `stdinSteamGuard` - allows you to easily enter SteamGuard code using standard input

You don't have to use these in your projects of course.

Suggested order of examples for beginners:

* basic
* hello-world

After those two, continue with any other example that interests you.
